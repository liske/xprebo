xprebod
=======

 xprebo connects to an XMPP/Jabber server and shows a presence status.
 The status and the message can be changed by feeding new events into
 named pipes. This makes it usable by scripts.

The current version does not support precense subscription, yet. You
will need to do the presence subscription with your favorite XMPP
client or use a XMPP server with shared roster support like ejabberd.


Implemented XEPs
================

xprebod has the following XEPs implemented:

 XEP-0012: Last Activity
 XEP-0030: Service Discovery
 XEP-0054: vcard-temp
 XEP-0092: Software Version
 XEP-0199: XMPP Ping
 XEP-0202: Entity Time


SRV lookup support in Net::XMPP
===============================

Net::XMPP did not support SRV records to get the XMPP server of the
users JID. XMPP requires the client to lookup the server by SRV records
in the DNS. See also the following bug reports including a fix:

    http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18539#txn-249050
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=325658

To get SRV lookup work, you must have at least

    Net::XMPP >= 1.02_02
    XML::Stream >= 1.23_04

installed and enable the following lines in your xprebo.conf:

    $xmpp_conf{'componentname'} = $xmpp_conf{'hostname'};
    $xmpp_conf{'srv'} = 1;
